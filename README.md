# Google Analytics Measurement Protocol
A wrapper for Coldfusion Coldbox

## What is it good for?
Imagine you want to track anything within Google Analytics which can not use the GA Javascript tracking code
E.g. track api traffic, events which are fired from your internal crm

## Installation 
This ColdBox Module can be installed using CommandBox:

```
box install GoogleAnalyticsMeasurementProtocol
```



### ColdBox Module
If you are using Coldbox 4.3 or later, we recommend to setup the Api in your central Coldbox.cfc config like

```
 	moduleSettings = {
    		mailchimpV3 = {
        		apikey='YOUR API Key goes here'
    	  	}

```

## Usage
```
var mp=getModel('MeasurementProtocol');
mp.setTrackingId('UA-xxxxxx-x');
mp.setDocumentLocationUrl('http://yourdomain/yourUrl?q=test');
mp.setIpOverride('xx.xx.xx.xx');
mp.setClientId(MeasurementProtocolService.CreateUUIDv4());
//writeDump(mp);

MeasurementProtocolService.send(mp);

```
